	Behind the scenes
		Each "room" is an entry in the database that creates a student id and an instructor id
		Both id's will be a long string (about 200 characters or so)
		Loading room.php will grab that student id and instructor id from the database and load that into the javascript in one form or another
		nodeapp.js will transmit from the student id to the teacher id, and vice versa
